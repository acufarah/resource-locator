## Overview
[Abode Services](https://abodeservices.org), is an agency that works with government and local communities to address homelessness.  
Abode's Rapid Re-Housing division works with local faith organizations to gather housing resources for their clients. This involves gathering furniture and household resources for clients recently placed in housing.  The process involves monthly meetings where representatives of the faith organization and  Abode representations meet and discuss current needs and an action plan to supply those needs. 
The web site I'm proposing will make this process more efficient by allowing organizations interested in helping, to register with Abode. The site shows what items are needed (Wanted). Organizations can post furniture or household items for donation. An Abode admin can also view all donation listings where they can search or filter by location. This will help in planning for the resource needs of specific clients.


## Motivation
As a volunteer member of Code for America Brigades, we collaborate with local government and community partners to build new tools that help with local civic issues.
