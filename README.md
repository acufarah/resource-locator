## Overview
[Abode Services](https://abodeservices.org), is an agency that works with government and local communities to address homelessness.  
Abode's Rapid Re-Housing division involves gathering furniture and household resources for clients recently placed in housing.  Abode partners with local faith organizations to gather the needed resources for their clients.  This usually involves monthly meetings where representatives of the faith org meets with Abode to discuss needs and an action plan to supply those needs.  This is mostly a manual process.  
The web site I'm proposing will make this process more efficient by allowing organizations interested in helping, to register with Abode.  The site shows what items are needed (Wanted). Organizations can post furniture or household items for donation.  An Abode admin can also view all donation listings where they can search or filter by location.  This  will help in planning for the resource needs of specific clients.

## Motivation
As a volunteer member of Code for America Brigades, we collaborate with local government and community partners to build new tools that help with local civic issues.
